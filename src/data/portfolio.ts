    "Enterprise Power Platform & Dynamics 365 Solution Architect | Dataverse Data Architect | ALM & AI Engineering Lead",
  tagline:
    "Dataverse-first architecture · 16 production Power Apps · Enterprise ALM · 28+ departments modernized",
  bio: `Enterprise Power Platform & Dynamics 365 Solution Architect with 7+ years of service delivery, operations leadership, and dual-track transformation experience spanning low-code Canvas Apps, code-first React/TypeScript platforms, and Dataverse data architecture.

Proven track record leading large-scale digital modernization at a publicly listed Malaysian conglomerate (palm oil, oleochemicals, property) — cataloguing 361 legacy Lotus Domino forms and migrating them into a modern Microsoft 365 environment. The architecture follows a deliberate two-phase strategy: Phase 1 deployed 16 production Canvas Apps using SharePoint Online strictly as an interim staging data store to eliminate $960K/year in premium licensing during rapid migration (28+ department sites), while Phase 2 — the Dataverse Migration Blueprint — defines the enterprise-grade target architecture with full relational data modeling, Business Unit hierarchy, Security Role inheritance, Field Security Profiles, polymorphic lookups, and managed solution ALM. SharePoint Online is explicitly a migration staging layer, not a production data architecture.

Core expertise spans Dataverse solution design with managed/unmanaged solution boundaries, environment strategy (Dev → Build → Test → Prod), connection reference management, environment variables, C# Dataverse Plugins with pre/post-operation execution pipeline stages, PCF Controls (TypeScript/React), and Solution Segmentation for enterprise ALM. Production CI/CD pipelines implemented via GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps with Power Platform Build Tools — see the .github/workflows/ directory for inspectable pipeline definitions. AI-assisted development with domain-specific Copilot agents for code generation, QA testing, and documentation acceleration, governed by DLP policies, content filtering, and Microsoft Copilot Studio architecture. Power Platform governance aligned to WCAG 2.2 AA, OWASP Top 10, and GxP compliance standards, with 98%+ SLA compliance.

Self-taught developer who pioneered Power Platform adoption on the BPO operations floor in 2021, building end-to-end operational tools using Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint to manage teams, track KPIs, and automate workflows.`,

  overview: `Led the enterprise-wide modernization of 361 legacy Lotus Domino business applications across 28+ departments. The architecture follows a deliberate two-phase strategy: Phase 1 deployed 16 production Power Apps using SharePoint Online strictly as an interim staging data store — leveraging existing M365 E3/E5 licensing to eliminate $960K/year in premium connector costs during rapid migration. Phase 2, the Dataverse Migration Blueprint, defines the enterprise-grade target architecture: full relational data modeling with MainDB parent tables and polymorphic child lookups, Business Unit hierarchy mapped to departmental data isolation, Security Role inheritance with 5-tier approval matrices, Field Security Profiles for PII/financial data, alternate keys for Oracle ERP bidirectional sync, and managed solution ALM with staged environment promotion.
